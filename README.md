# Valheim Creature Level and Loot Control vanilla yamls

This project contains the simple plain yaml files for vanilla Valheim. 
To make use of this mod, just add it as a dependency. It will load the creature and items groups (generated using [VNEI](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/MSchmoecker/VNEI/) ), you then can use the groups inside your own yaml (CLLC accumulates all yamls) by referending the group name. You can also use it to just have a reference to the full list of creatures and items in game.

To make use of the YAMLs, you will still need to load the [CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/) mod, this mod does not include the dependency to load it.
